## Introduction to SQL

### What is SQL?
- **Definition**: SQL is a standard language for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data in relational database management systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle.
- **Purpose**: Enables data definition (DDL), data manipulation (DML), and data control (DCL).
- **Key Features**:
  - Declarative: Specify what you want, not how to get it.
  - Case-insensitive (e.g., `SELECT` = `select`).
  - Supports ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

### Sample Database
Weâ€™ll use a simple database with two tables:
- **Employees**:
  | ID  | Name       | Department | Salary  | Hire_Date  |
  |-----|------------|------------|---------|------------|
  | 1   | Alice      | HR         | 50000   | 2023-01-15 |
  | 2   | Bob        | IT         | 60000   | 2022-06-10 |
  | 3   | Charlie    | IT         | 55000   | 2023-03-20 |
  | 4   | Diana      | Finance    | 65000   | 2022-11-05 |

- **Departments**:
  | Dept_ID | Dept_Name | Location    |
  |---------|-----------|-------------|
  | 1       | HR        | New York    |
  | 2       | IT        | Bangalore   |
  | 3       | Finance   | London      |

## SQL Basics

### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
Used to define and modify database structures.

- **CREATE TABLE**:
  Creates a new table.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Employees (
      ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      Name VARCHAR(50),
      Department VARCHAR(50),
      Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
      Hire_Date DATE
  );
  ```

- **ALTER TABLE**:
  Modifies an existing table.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Employees
  ADD COLUMN Email VARCHAR(100);
  ```

- **DROP TABLE**:
  Deletes a table.
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE Employees;
  ```

- **TRUNCATE TABLE**:
  Removes all data but keeps the table structure.
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
  ```

---

### 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Used to manipulate data within tables.

- **INSERT**:
  Adds new rows.
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Department, Salary, Hire_Date)
  VALUES (5, 'Eve', 'HR', 52000, '2024-01-10');
  ```

- **SELECT**:
  Retrieves data.
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, Salary
  FROM Employees;
  ```
  **Output**:
  | Name    | Salary |
  |---------|--------|
  | Alice   | 50000  |
  | Bob     | 60000  |
  | Charlie | 55000  |
  | Diana   | 65000  |
  | Eve     | 52000  |

- **UPDATE**:
  Modifies existing data.
  ```sql
  UPDATE Employees
  SET Salary = 62000
  WHERE ID = 2;
  ```

- **DELETE**:
  Removes rows.
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Employees
  WHERE ID = 5;
  ```

---

### 3. Data Query Language (DQL)
Focuses on querying data.

- **SELECT with WHERE**:
  Filters rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, Department
  FROM Employees
  WHERE Salary > 55000;
  ```
  **Output**:
  | Name   | Department |
  |--------|------------|
  | Bob    | IT         |
  | Diana  | Finance    |

- **SELECT with ORDER BY**:
  Sorts results.
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, Salary
  FROM Employees
  ORDER BY Salary DESC;
  ```
  **Output**:
  | Name   | Salary |
  |--------|--------|
  | Diana  | 65000  |
  | Bob    | 60000  |
  | Charlie| 55000  |
  | Alice  | 50000  |

- **SELECT with DISTINCT**:
  Removes duplicates.
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT Department
  FROM Employees;
  ```
  **Output**:
  | Department |
  |------------|
  | HR         |
  | IT         |
  | Finance    |

## Advanced SQL Queries

### 1. Joins
Combine data from multiple tables.

- **INNER JOIN**:
  Matches rows with common values.
  ```sql
  SELECT e.Name, d.Location
  FROM Employees e
  INNER JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.Dept_Name;
  ```
  **Output**:
  | Name    | Location  |
  |---------|-----------|
  | Alice   | New York  |
  | Bob     | Bangalore |
  | Charlie | Bangalore |
  | Diana   | London    |

- **LEFT JOIN**:
  Includes all rows from the left table.
  ```sql
  SELECT e.Name, d.Location
  FROM Employees e
  LEFT JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.Dept_Name;
  ```

- **RIGHT JOIN**:
  Includes all rows from the right table.
  ```sql
  SELECT e.Name, d.Location
  FROM Employees e
  RIGHT JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.Dept_Name;
  ```

- **FULL JOIN**:
  Includes all rows from both tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT e.Name, d.Location
  FROM Employees e
  FULL JOIN Departments d ON e.Department = d.Dept_Name;
  ```

---

### 2. Aggregate Functions
Perform calculations on data.

- **COUNT**:
  Counts rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT Department, COUNT(*) as Employee_Count
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY Department;
  ```
  **Output**:
  | Department | Employee_Count |
  |------------|----------------|
  | HR         | 2              |
  | IT         | 2              |
  | Finance    | 1              |

- **SUM**, **AVG**, **MAX**, **MIN**:
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(Salary) as Total_Salary, AVG(Salary) as Avg_Salary
  FROM Employees;
  ```
  **Output**:
  | Total_Salary | Avg_Salary |
  |--------------|------------|
  | 230000       | 57500      |

- **GROUP BY with HAVING**:
  Filters grouped results.
  ```sql
  SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) as Avg_Salary
  FROM Employees
  GROUP BY Department
  HAVING AVG(Salary) > 55000;
  ```
  **Output**:
  | Department | Avg_Salary |
  |------------|------------|
  | IT         | 57500      |
  | Finance    | 65000      |

### 3. Subqueries and Nested Queries

- **Subquery in SELECT**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, (SELECT Location FROM Departments WHERE Dept_Name = e.Department) as Location
  FROM Employees e;
  ```

- **Subquery in WHERE**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Name, Salary
  FROM Employees
  WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
  ```
  **Output**:
  | Name   | Salary |
  |--------|--------|
  | Bob    | 60000  |
  | Diana  | 65000  |

- **EXISTS**:
  ```sql
  SELECT Name
  FROM Employees e
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Departments d WHERE d.Dept_Name = e.Department);
  ```

---

### 4. Indexes and Performance

- **CREATE INDEX**:
  Improves query speed.
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_dept ON Employees(Department);
  ```

- **DROP INDEX**:
  Removes an index.
  ```sql
  DROP INDEX idx_dept;
  ```

---

## Data Control Language (DCL)

- **GRANT**:
  Assigns permissions.
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT ON Employees TO 'user'@'localhost';
  ```

- **REVOKE**:
  Removes permissions.
  ```sql
  REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM 'user'@'localhost';
  ```

---

## Transaction Control Language (TCL)

- **COMMIT**:
  Saves changes.
  ```sql
  COMMIT;
  ```

- **ROLLBACK**:
  Undoes changes.
  ```sql
  ROLLBACK;
  ```

- **SAVEPOINT**:
  Sets a savepoint.
  ```sql
  SAVEPOINT savepoint1;
  ```

---

## Practical Examples

### 1. Employee Salary Report
```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) as Avg_Salary, COUNT(*) as Employee_Count
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY Avg_Salary DESC;
```
**Output**:
| Department | Avg_Salary | Employee_Count |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| IT         | 57500      | 2              |
| HR         | 51000      | 2              |

### 2. Join with Aggregation
```sql
SELECT d.Location, COUNT(e.ID) as Employee_Count
FROM Departments d
LEFT JOIN Employees e ON d.Dept_Name = e.Department
GROUP BY d.Location;
```
**Output**:
| Location  | Employee_Count |
|-----------|----------------|
| New York  | 2              |
| Bangalore | 2              |
| London    | 1              |

## Best Practices

- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, consistent names (e.g., `tbl_employees`).
- **Indexing**: Index frequently queried columns.
- **Backup**: Regularly back up databases.
- **Security**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
